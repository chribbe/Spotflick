Spotflick 

To test the app in Spotify:

1. put the files in a folder and name it "spotflick"

2. place the folder inside the “Spotify” folder in your home folder (or “My Documents” in Windows). Launch Spotify, type spotify:app:$spotflick in the search bar and Spotify will load the application, offering to pin it to the sidebar for easy access later.
